      <p style="color: #b3b3b3; font-size: 17px;"> Growing up, I always used to feel a little detached from reality. It might have just been my overactive imagination, but regardless I would often let my fanciful ideas dictate my thoughts and actions. In fact, I felt more grounded in fictional worlds than the one I lived in. I was always fascinated by the new realities created within novels, stories, video games, tv shows, and movies because of the depth of the characters, their relationships, and their backgrounds. A narrativeâ€™s ability to sculpt new worlds and realms captivates me.
      <br>
      <br>
      Through art, I experiment with fiction and storytelling mainly involving themes of human emotion, identity, and existence. While my initial interest in narrative stems from its escapist qualities, I strive for my work to reflect concepts that can be applied and related to real life. As a digital media artist, I try to experiment with numerous different media from digital illustration to video art to web design. My artistic practice also includes the use of other mediums such as pencil, ink, charcoal, and paint. Currently, I am pursuing new ways to incorporate interactivity into my artwork in order to deepen the connection between the viewer and the experience of the artwork. I am particularly interested in establishing a collaborative relationship between the artist and the viewer with art in which both parties play a role in determining the conclusion such as through an interactive story or a video game. </p>

      <p style="color: #b3b3b3; font-size: 17px;"> Generally, the focuses of my visual and written works are the characters within the pieces. When I was first exploring art, I would come up with names for the fictional people I drew while imagining what kind of individuals they would be and how they would interact with others. In order to humanize the characters as much as possible, I made sure to give them multifaceted personalities and detailed life stories to represent the complexity of humanity and life. A lot of my exploration of art has been in service of helping myself and my audience understand others and human nature better. My work invites the viewer to explore the concepts of public and personal identities. I hope that the viewer is able to step into the shoes of the illustrated individual and see the world through a new set of eyes. The depth of the narratives within each of my pieces vary. While some can be more solemn and meaningful, others are more light-hearted and fun.
      <br>
      <br>
      As I continue to create more art, I plan to diversify the variety of the styles and media used in my work and dive further into the contradictory and multifaceted depths of the human mind.
