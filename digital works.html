                <p>With an image from one of my favorite movies called What We Do in the Shadows, I used Audacity to create a glitched version. My process involved adding a single effect to the file and saving to see what changed. As a result, I ended up with a collection of images that show the progression from the original image to the finished glitch. The final glitched image shows the effects of numerous different changes and saves. I chose to glitch this image because I wanted to portray how the variations of vampires within movies and fiction creates a blurred idea of the vampire identity.</p>

                <p>The late Queen Lulu is the first queen of the Llurtle Kingdom where a unique half-llama and half-turtle species known as the llurtles reside. Although Queen Lulu is remembered by the citizens of the Llurtle Kingdom thousands of years later for her humility and kind heart, she was anything but. No one throughout the history of the entire kingdom was more vain or cruel than Queen Lulu. In her prime, Queen Lulu was envied for her beauty and grace. However, Queen Lulu’s attractiveness was only skin deep. She treated her staff and anyone of lower status as if they were worse than a pile of flying llurtle scat. She tormented her maids, insulted her chefs, ignored the llurtle citizens’ grievances, threw herself at anything that breathed, and put herself above anything or anyone else. In spite of her horrendous personality, Queen Lulu’s husband, King Larry, loved her unconditionally. As a result, King Larry made sure that Queen Lulu went down in llurtle history as one of the kindest souls. There are hundreds of sculptures and statues of Queen Lulu scattered around the kingdom where the llurtle citizens go to pay their respects to the late not so kind-hearted queen.</p>

                <p>New Media Art involves the search for and experimentation with novel and different ways of making art. These practices can include anything from virtual to conceptual art. For instance, Carla Gannis, Daniel Temkin, and LaTurbo Avedon represent New Media Art in different ways through their work.</p>
                <p>Carla Gannis is an American transmedia artist who works from Brooklyn, New York. Gannis graduated with an MFA in painting from Boston University and is currently the Assistant Chair of the Department of Digital Arts at Pratt Institute. Gannis began to blend digital elements and styles in with her mainly painting-based work in the late 1990s. Her work then developed into the remixes and collages which showcase alienation and democratization in technology that she is known for today.</p>
                <p>Through her work, Gannis explores the nature of identity as a compound where the real and virtual versions of the self intertwine. While Gannis breaks down stiff barriers of perception and reality, her viewers are able to realize how mediated contemporary life is through the digital lens. Gannis’ 52 digital drawing series “The Selfie Drawings” was published in a public online space. The series was a year long project from 2015 to 2016 where Gannis illustrated “the self.” The project involved a combination of modern selfie photography and traditional self portraits. In the series, Gannis explores her personal and public identity hidden from and revealed in the digital world. </p>

                <p>Similarly to Carla Gannis, I want to explore identity within my own artwork with relation to who people are and how they want to be and are perceived by others.</p>
                <p>Daniel Temkin creates images, interactive works, and programming languages while exploring different systems of language and logic. In 2012, Temkin received an MFA in Advanced Photographic Studies from the International Center of Photography/ Bard College. Temkin’s experimentation with programming as a form of art, the discrepancies between algorithmic and human thought, and the fragmented patterns of thinking. Temkin’s ongoing project, Glitchometry, is a collaborative project between machine and man. Since there is a trade-off in control of creation of the work between the machine and the image manipulator, the resulting images are representations of the relationship between humans and machines where the compulsiveness that comes from humanity’s attempts to logically think and the desire for accessible forms of tumultuous processes clash.</p>

                <p>Temkin’s Glitchometry project inspires me to perform my own experiments on the collaboration between myself and machines with the creation of artworks.</p>
                <p>LaTurbo Avedon is an avatar curator and artist who originates from virtual space and works on the internet. Avedon’s work emphasizes the concept of authorship and identity that is nonphysical. Avedon’s process of creating character is present in their performance, gaming, and exhibitions. Along with the exploration of the physicality of the internet and the idea of virtual authorship, Avedon also researches the explosions, deconstructions, and dimensions of forms. Avedon’s piece ID is a 2015 projection installation that deals with the identification of the digital self. The work is meant to address how social media applications have carried on towards the development of authenticators that add real name policies and the addition of greedy terms of service in order to gain access to more personal information from users.</p>

              <br>
              <div>
                <p>Avedon as an artist caught my attention quickly, being an avatar that creates their own work. However, their work kept my interest because of its character based elements. Avedon’s existence and work are both explorations of the relationship between the real and virtual worlds which is part of what I want to do with my own work.</p>
                <p>Therefore, Carla Gannis, Daniel Temkin, and LaTurbo Avedon are all artists that represent New Media Art. Each, in their own way, explores new techniques and ways to create art.</p>
