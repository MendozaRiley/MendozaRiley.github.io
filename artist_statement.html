      <p style="color: #b3b3b3; font-size: 17px;"> Growing up, I always used to feel a little detached from reality. It might have just been my overactive imagination, but regardless I would often let my fanciful ideas dictate my thoughts and actions. In fact, I felt more grounded in fictional worlds than the one I lived in. I was always fascinated by the new realities created within novels, stories, video games, tv shows, and movies because of the depth of the characters, their relationships, and their backgrounds. A narrativeâ€™s ability to sculpt new worlds and realms captivates me. Through art, I experiment with fiction and storytelling mainly involving themes of human emotion, identity, and existence. While I plan to focus more on digital media, I also create pieces using other mediums such as pencil, ink, charcoal, and paint. I have more illustration experience, but code has recently piqued my interest and I am going to learn more about how to use code to make art. Generally, the focuses of my visual and written works are the characters within the pieces. When I was first exploring art, I would come up with names for the fictional people I drew while imagining what kind of individuals they would be and how they would interact with others.</p>

    <div class="col-sm-12">
      <p style="color: #b3b3b3; font-size: 17px;"> In order to humanize the characters as much as possible, I made sure to give them multifaceted personalities and detailed life stories to represent the complexity of humanity and life. A lot of my exploration of art has been in service of helping myself and my audience understanding others and human nature better. My work invites the viewer to explore the concepts of public and personal identities. I hope that the viewer is able to step into the shoes of the illustrated individual and see the world through a new set of eyes. The depth of the narratives within each of my pieces vary. While some can be more solemn and meaningful, others are more light-hearted and fun. As I continue to create more art, I plan to diversify the variety of the styles and media used in my work and dive further into the contradictory and multifaceted depths of the human mind.</p>
